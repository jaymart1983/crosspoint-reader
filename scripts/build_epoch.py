"""
PlatformIO pre-build script: inject the firmware's build epoch as
CROSSPOINT_BUILD_EPOCH (UTC seconds since 1970, an integer constant).

Why the firmware carries a timestamp at all: the PCF8563/DS3231/RX8130 RTC ships
with a stopped oscillator, so a device that has never been told the time by a
BLE client reads as "unknown" and every reading position it saves goes unstamped
-- losing every sync conflict. A device cannot be older than the firmware
running on it, so the build epoch is a sound *lower bound* for the wall clock and
HalClock::begin() seeds the RTC with it on first boot (see lib/hal/HalClock.cpp).

The value is the HEAD commit time, not `now`:

  * It is UTC. `git log --format=%ct` is committer time in epoch seconds, with no
    time-zone ambiguity -- unlike __DATE__/__TIME__, which are local build time.
  * It is deterministic. Baking the wall clock in would change a global -D on
    every single build, invalidating the whole compile cache each time; the
    commit time only moves when the source does.
  * It is still a lower bound: the commit cannot postdate the build.

SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH overrides the git lookup when set, so a tree without a usable
repo (tarball, stripped CI checkout, `git worktree`, or sources copied to a build
host) can still be given a stable value instead of falling through to the wall
clock. Only if neither is available does it fall back to the actual build time,
which is likewise UTC and likewise a lower bound -- but which does change the
global -D on every build, and so costs a full recompile each time. In either case the value
is floored at 2020-01-01 so it can never be a value HalClock would reject.

    The reproducible-builds standard variable. It exists for exactly the case
    this script cannot otherwise handle: a build tree with no usable git repo.
    That covers a source tarball, a CI checkout that strips .git, a `git
    worktree` whose .git is a pointer to a gitdir outside the tree -- and a
    build host the sources were copied to without .git, which is how the
    CrossPoint X4 Pro builds run. In all of those the git lookup below fails
    and the fallback is the wall clock, which changes this global -D on every
    build and so invalidates the entire compile cache every time: the very
    thing the module docstring set out to avoid.

    The caller floors and range-checks the result, so a malformed value is no
    more dangerous here than a bad commit time.
