// Top-anchored control center opened by a status-bar tap or by a power-button
// tap (iOS Control Center style): a grabber, the frontlight
// brightness/warmth sliders (on boards with a light), and a grid of
// quick-setting tiles — night mode, ghost-cleanup refresh, reading orientation,
// frontlight, touchscreen on/off, sleep, settings and home. The frontlight
// controls are always there: they are what the panel is for. Pure 1-bit: no
// dithered fills, a tile whose setting is on reads as a filled tile. The
// grabber sits along the panel's bottom edge, the edge the sheet is dragged
// from.
//
// This panel is also the recovery screen for a device whose touchscreen has
// been switched off — the Touch tile is the only way back on — so it has to be
// fully workable from buttons alone: a power tap opens it and a ~1 s power hold
// closes it, the navigation keys move a tile cursor, and Confirm (a hold on the
// Right side key on the X4 Pro, which MappedInputManager folds into Confirm
// outside a book) activates the focused tile.
