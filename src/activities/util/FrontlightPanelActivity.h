// Top-anchored control center opened by a status-bar tap or by a power-button
// tap (iOS Control Center style): a grabber, the frontlight
// brightness/warmth sliders (on boards with a light), and a grid of
// quick-setting tiles — night mode, ghost-cleanup refresh, reading orientation,
// touchscreen on/off, sleep, settings and home. The frontlight controls are
// always there: they are what the panel is for, and the lamp button that sits
// after the brightness row's + is the on/off switch — there is deliberately no
// separate Frontlight TILE duplicating it. Pure 1-bit: no dithered fills, a
// tile whose setting is on reads as a filled tile. The grabber sits along the
// panel's bottom edge, the edge the sheet is dragged from.
//
// The sheet lays out in whatever frame it opens over and never turns the
// renderer itself (an earlier pass forced portrait for as long as it was up).
// That means it has to fit both the 480x800 portrait frame and the X4 Pro's
// 800x480 landscape one, which is what computeLayout() below is for.
//
// This panel is also the recovery screen for a device whose touchscreen has
// been switched off — the Touch tile is the only way back on — so it has to be
// fully workable from buttons alone: a power tap opens it and a ~1 s power hold
// closes it, the navigation keys move a tile cursor, and Confirm (a hold on the
// Right side key on the X4 Pro, which MappedInputManager folds into Confirm
// outside a book) activates the focused tile.
