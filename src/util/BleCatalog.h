// The wire shape of a Calibre catalogue page or book detail, as the phone app
// uploads it, and the parser that turns one into something the Store screen can
// draw.
//
// WHY A CONTAINER RATHER THAN JSON. A page is text (titles, authors, a blurb)
// and pictures (one cover thumbnail per book). Base64 inside JSON would cost a
// third more bytes on a link where bytes are the whole constraint, and would
// force the device to hold a decoded page in RAM. So the payload is one binary
// blob -- a short JSON header followed by the thumbnails, back to back -- pushed
// through the ordinary `start_put` upload path with its framing, credit flow
// control and SHA-256 unchanged. The device stages it on SD like every other
// upload, then reads the header (bounded, kilobytes) and copies each thumbnail
// out to its own small file. Nothing larger than one 512-byte buffer is ever
// resident, and the covers are then drawn straight off the card by the ordinary
// Bitmap/drawBitmap1Bit path.

// the device already blits exactly this: GfxRenderer::drawBitmap() routes a
// 1-bit Bitmap to drawBitmap1Bit(), which is a row copy with no dithering, no
// scaling table and no intermediate buffer.
//
// The app does the dithering. It has the CPU and the original artwork; the
// device has neither. Greyscale was rejected on size: a 4-bit 72x108 cover is
// 3.9 KB against 1.03 KB for 1-bit, which is the difference between a page that
// arrives in about a second and one that takes four.
//

// under the header and the button hints.
