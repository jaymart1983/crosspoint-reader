// The reader's Bluetooth link. One NimBLE peripheral, one hello/HMAC gate, one
// framed upload path with credit flow control and SHA-256, one download path.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT AN ACTIVITY. It used to be: BleTransferActivity owned the
// radio, so the link existed only while its screen was open and died the moment
// the user left. That made the phone app's job impossible -- it could not reach
// a reader that was showing a book, and the Store could not ask the phone for a
// catalogue page unless the radio happened to be up for another reason. The
// radio is a property of the device being awake, not of any one screen, so it
// lives here and is started once at boot (main.cpp) and stopped on the way into
// deep sleep. Wake from deep sleep is a chip reset, so start-on-boot is also
// start-on-wake.
//
// WHAT A SCREEN DOES INSTEAD. A screen that wants to show link state registers
// as an Observer and is told when something changed; it repaints itself. The
// Store additionally attaches its controller so the request channel has
// somewhere to publish to. Neither owns the radio and neither can take it down.
//
// PAIRING lives in exactly one place, BlePairingActivity in Settings. A host is
// written to flash the instant a `hello` carrying the right six-digit code also
// carries a credential -- not after some later upload completes. The old
// after-an-upload rule is what produced the deadlock this class was rebuilt to
// end: the phone saved its half of the pairing immediately, the reader saved its
// half only if the session happened to finish a transfer, and every later
// reconnect authenticated against a credential the reader had never kept.
