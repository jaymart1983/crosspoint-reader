//   /firmware/firmware.bin           the ESP32 application image
//   /firmware/firmware.bin.sha256    its SHA-256, as text
//
// The companion file's first whitespace-delimited token is a 64-character
// lowercase hex SHA-256 of the image. That is exactly the first field of
// `sha256sum firmware.bin` output, so the file a person would produce by hand
// and the file the app writes are the same file. Case is not significant and a
// trailing newline is fine.
//
// WHAT THE HASH DOES AND DOES NOT DO. It proves the image on the card is the
// image whoever wrote the hash meant to put there -- it catches a truncated
// copy, a half-finished BLE upload, a card that went bad. It proves NOTHING
// about who wrote it. Anyone who can write firmware.bin can write
// firmware.bin.sha256 in the same breath, so this is an INTEGRITY check, not an
// authenticity check, and it is not a signature. That is an accepted trade for a
// personal device whose SD card is already writable by anyone holding it and
// whose USB port is already total control; it is written down here so it is a
// decision on the record rather than a guarantee anyone inferred. The checks
// that actually stop a bad image bricking the reader are
// firmware_flash::validateImageFile() and the on-device confirmation prompt,
// and neither of those is weakened by any of this.
