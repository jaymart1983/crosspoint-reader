# BLE Transfer Protocol

CrossPoint Reader advertises this service **whenever the device is awake**. It is not owned by any screen: it
starts at the end of boot, stops on the way into deep sleep, and comes back on wake (which is a chip reset, so
"on wake" and "at boot" are the same code path). There is no Bluetooth Transfer screen any more, and there is no
longer any screen a user has to find and keep open before a phone can reach the reader.

Advertising runs at a deliberately slow interval — 1000-1285 ms — because this link is for occasional sync, not
low latency. A scanning phone still finds the reader within a second or two.

The browser companion is available at <https://ble.xteink.lol/>. Source and compatibility notes live at

## Compatibility

- Protocol version: `1`
- Device name: `CrossPoint Transfer`
- Service UUID: `6f9f0a00-9b1d-4d1f-9f53-5b6b8b3d0f10`

Clients should discover the service by UUID. The user-visible name is not part of the compatibility contract.

## Characteristics

| Name | UUID | Direction | Properties |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `control` | `6f9f0a01-9b1d-4d1f-9f53-5b6b8b3d0f10` | client to reader | write with response |
| `data-in` | `6f9f0a02-9b1d-4d1f-9f53-5b6b8b3d0f10` | client to reader | write, write without response |
| `status` | `6f9f0a03-9b1d-4d1f-9f53-5b6b8b3d0f10` | reader to client | read, notify (the read and the notification carry *different* documents — see [The Store](#the-store-requests-over-the-notify-channel)) |
| `data-out` | `6f9f0a04-9b1d-4d1f-9f53-5b6b8b3d0f10` | reader to client | notify |

## Authentication

First use requires the six-digit code, which lives on exactly one screen: **Settings > Bluetooth**. That page always
shows the code — paired or not, connected or not, whatever the last failure was.

```json
{"op":"hello","version":1,"code":"123456"}
```

The code is regenerated once per wake, not once per screen, so it is stable for as long as the device stays awake.

### Pairing is saved immediately

A client that wants to be remembered includes `pair_host_id`, `pair_host_name` and `pair_secret` in the same `hello`.
**The reader writes the credential to flash the moment that hello is accepted.** There is no prompt and no later step.

This is a behaviour change, and it is the whole reason this document was revised. The reader used to save a trusted
host only through an on-device prompt that appeared *after a completed authenticated upload*. Every real client saves
its half of the pairing as soon as it sends `pair_secret`, so a session that paired but never finished an upload left
the two sides disagreeing: the client held a credential the reader had never kept, its next reconnect authenticated by
HMAC against nothing, and the refusal used to be shown on an error screen that replaced the six-digit code — the one
thing needed to recover. Both halves are now committed at the same instant.

The user's consent is the six digits themselves. They were read off the reader's own pairing page and typed into the
client; there is no second question worth asking.

`save_host` still exists and is still accepted, but it now does nothing except republish `status`: by the time a client
could send it, the credential is already saved.

### Trusted auth

Trusted auth signs this message:

```text
{device_nonce}|{host_id}|1
```

using HMAC-SHA256 with the saved secret.

### When a hello is refused

A refused `hello` is **not** a failed session and never enters `state: "error"`. The link stays up, the code stays on
the pairing page, and the reason is reported in `status` as `auth_error` — a separate field from `error`, cleared by
the next accepted hello. This matters because the only recovery from a refused trusted-host hello is to read that code.

Read `auth_error` together with `has_trusted_host` to tell the cases apart:

| `auth_error` | `has_trusted_host` | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `unknown trusted host` | `false` | Nobody is paired here. Forget the saved credential and pair with the code. |
| `unknown trusted host` | `true` | A different host is paired. Pair with the code to replace it. |
| `invalid trusted host auth` | `true` | The credential is for this reader but the signature did not verify. |

`has_trusted_host` is carried in notifications as well as in the GATT read, because a client that only listens to the
doorbell needs it at exactly the moment its trusted hello was refused.

### Forgetting

The user forgets a phone from Settings > Bluetooth. There is no protocol operation for it: a client cannot make the
reader forget anybody.

## Supported Operations

Uploads use `start_put`, binary frames on `data-in`, then `commit`.

Supported upload kinds:

- `book`: `.epub` saved under `/Books`
- `bmp`: `.bmp` saved under `/Pictures`
- `firmware`: `.bin` **dropped into the watched folder** — see [Firmware updates](#firmware-updates). It is validated
  on commit and then left there; nothing is flashed during the session
- `progress`: a batch of reading positions to apply to books already on the card (see below)
- `catalog_page`: one screen of the app's Calibre library, answering a `catalog_page` request (see
  [The Store](#the-store-requests-over-the-notify-channel))
- `catalog_detail`: one book in full, answering a `catalog_detail` request

Downloads use `start_get`, notifications on `data-out`, and one `get_ack` per frame.

Supported download kinds:

- `crash_report`: reads `/crash_report.txt`
- `library`: the on-device book list with reading progress (see below)
- `progress_result`: the per-entry outcome of the last `progress` upload (see below)

There are two further control ops that are not transfers: `set_time`, and `catalog_error` (the app declining
a Store request it cannot answer). `save_host` is accepted and does nothing (see
[Pairing is saved immediately](#pairing-is-saved-immediately)).

## Firmware updates

A firmware push is now a **file drop**, not an interactive flow. The reader watches one folder:

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `/firmware/firmware.bin` | the ESP32 application image |
| `/firmware/firmware.bin.sha256` | its SHA-256, as text |
| `/firmware/.firmware.bin.part` | scratch: where a BLE upload accumulates before the rename |

The companion file's **first whitespace-delimited token** is a 64-character hex SHA-256 of the image. That is exactly
the first field of `sha256sum firmware.bin`, so the file a person writes by hand and the file the app writes are the
same file. Case is not significant; a trailing newline is fine.

Two routes put files there, and they are the same route:

- **Over BLE.** `start_put` with `kind: "firmware"`, frames, `commit` — unchanged wire protocol. On commit the reader
  validates the image (`firmware_flash::validateImageFile`: header magic, segment table, XOR checksum, SHA-256
  trailer, chip id, board tag) and, if it passes, writes `/firmware/firmware.bin.sha256` itself from the digest it
  just verified. The client does not send the hash file. `status` reports `state: "saved"`; a bad image reports
  `state: "error"` with `error: "invalid firmware: <REASON>"` while the client is still connected to hear it.
- **Over USB.** Plug the reader into a computer, copy both files onto the card, eject.

The reader then checks the folder every 30 seconds, re-hashes the image off the card a few KB per main-loop tick, and
only if the digest matches the companion file does it show an **on-device confirmation prompt**. Confirming runs the
same validate-and-flash path the SD firmware update always used, then reboots. Both files are deleted after a
successful flash so the new firmware does not come up and offer to install itself again. Declining does **not** delete
anything: the reader simply stops offering that image until the file changes or the device reboots.

### The hash file verifies integrity, not authenticity

**This is not a signature and it is not a security boundary.** Anyone who can write `firmware.bin` can write
`firmware.bin.sha256` in the same breath. The digest proves the bytes on the card are the bytes whoever wrote the hash
intended to put there — it catches a truncated copy, an interrupted BLE upload, a failing SD card — and it proves
nothing whatsoever about who wrote them.

That is an accepted trade for a personal device: the SD card is already writable by anyone holding it, and USB access
to the reader is already total control, so a signature here would be guarding a door in an open field. It is written
down because it should be a decision on the record rather than a guarantee somebody infers from the word "hash".

What actually protects the device from a bad image is unchanged and was never the hash: `validateImageFile()` runs
twice (once when the file is staged, once at flash time, because the SD card is removable and that gap is real), and
the user has to confirm on the device itself.

The Store also runs **the other way round** — the device asks, the app answers — over the `status` notify
channel. See [The Store](#the-store-requests-over-the-notify-channel).

### `library`

`{"op":"start_get","kind":"library"}` makes the reader walk `/Books`, stage a JSON document on the SD card, and then
send it through the ordinary frame/ack path. `status` reports `state: "preparing"` while the shelf is being walked
(seconds on a large library), then `state: "sending"` with `kind: "library"`, `size`, and `sent` as usual. Like every
other operation it is refused until `hello` has been accepted.

The payload is a JSON array, one object per book:

```json
[
  {"filename":"Dune.epub","size":1048576,"title":"Dune","author":"Frank Herbert","percent":0.4237,
   "location":"0300170023000000","timestamp":1725600000},
  {"filename":"Classics/Ulysses.epub","size":2097152,"title":"Ulysses","author":"James Joyce","percent":0}
]
```

| Field | Type | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `filename` | string | Path relative to `/Books`, so a book in a sub-folder reads `Sub/Folder/Book.epub`. Always present. |
| `size` | number | Size of the book file in bytes. Always present. |
| `title` | string | The book's cached metadata title. Falls back to the bare filename when no metadata is available; never empty. |
| `author` | string | The book's cached metadata author. Empty string when unknown. |
| `percent` | number | Progress through the whole book, `0`–`1`, rounded to four decimals. `0` for a book that was never opened. **Display only** — never sync on this. Always present. |
| `location` | string | The saved position, exactly as the device stores it, hex-encoded. Absent for a book that was never opened. This is the field to sync on. |
| `timestamp` | number | UTC epoch seconds at which `location` was saved. **Absent means unknown**, not `0`. |
| `lastRead` | number | **Never emitted by this firmware.** Use `timestamp`. See below. |

Notes on the fields:

- Books are the formats the reader can open: `.epub`, `.xtc`/`.xtch`, `.txt`, `.md`. Sub-folders of `/Books` are walked
  to a depth of four; dot-entries are skipped. Entries are ordered per folder the way the file browser orders them.
- `title`/`author` come from the per-book metadata cache the reader writes the first time a book is opened, not from
  the recents list, so every book on the card is covered rather than only the ten most recent. A book that has never
  been opened has no EPUB metadata cached and lists under its filename with an empty author; the reader deliberately
  does not index books to answer this request. XTC books carry metadata in the file header, so they list correctly
  even before first open. `.txt`/`.md` have no embedded metadata at all and always list under their filename.
- `percent` is derived from the book's saved position, using the same mapping the reader and the KOReader sync path
  use. `.txt`/`.md` books always report `0`: their saved position is a page index whose page count depends on the
  current font, margins, and viewport, and none of that is recorded on disk, so no percentage can be recovered.
  `location` and `timestamp` are still exact for those books, which is why syncing on the stored position covers
  them and syncing on a percentage would not.
- `location` is the reader's own `progress.bin` byte for byte (see [Position encoding](#position-encoding)). Hand it
  straight back in a `progress` upload and the book reopens exactly where it was. Nothing anywhere converts a
  percentage into a position: that conversion is lossy — recovering a spine index and page from `0.4237` needs the
  book's pagination, which depends on the current font, margins and viewport — so it is not offered at all.
- `timestamp` is when that position was saved, from the device's own clock. On a board with an RTC it is effectively
  always present: the clock is started from the firmware's build epoch on first boot, so the device knows a time before
  any client has set one (see [Device clock](#device-clock)). It is omitted for a book whose position predates this
  firmware, for one whose sidecar was lost, and on a board with no RTC. Absent means unknown, and unknown loses every
  conflict.
- `lastRead` is specified as optional and this firmware still never emits it. It asked a vaguer question ("when was
  this book last read") than the sync path needs; `timestamp` answers the precise one and is what clients should use.

The document is streamed a book at a time, so it is never assembled in RAM. It is staged as
`/.crosspoint/ble-library.json` for the duration of the transfer and removed when the link stops (deep sleep). A
`start_get` at `offset: 0` rebuilds the listing; a non-zero `offset` resumes the document that the preceding
`offset: 0` request staged, so a resumed download never straddles two different snapshots.

## Position encoding

`location` is the reader's saved position with nothing done to it. On disk that position lives in
`progress.bin` inside the book's cache directory; its layout is private to the reader activity that wrote it
(EPUB: spine index, page, chapter page count and optionally a visible-text offset, in 4, 6 or 10 bytes; XTC and
`.txt`/`.md`: a 4-byte page index). The protocol does not know or care what the bytes mean.

To survive JSON they are **lowercase hex, two characters per byte, no separators and no prefix**. `location` is
therefore an even-length string of 8, 12 or 20 characters. Hex rather than base64 because a position is at most ten
bytes, hex stays readable in a log or a bug report, and it needs no padding or alphabet caveats.

```text
progress.bin bytes  03 00 17 00 23 00 00 00
location            "0300170023000000"
```

The round trip is byte-for-byte: whatever `library` reports in `location`, handing that same string back in a
`progress` upload writes exactly those bytes back into `progress.bin`. Clients must not construct, truncate, pad or
otherwise edit a `location` — only store one and return it.

The device does check the *length* against the book's type before writing (EPUB accepts 4, 6 or 10 bytes; XTC, `.txt`
and `.md` accept 4), because for EPUB the byte count selects the format and a wrong length would resume the book
somewhere arbitrary. A length the book's reader does not write is rejected as `invalid`.

## Device clock

A build without the network stack has no NTP, so **the phone sets the device clock**:

```json
{"op":"set_time","epoch":1725600000}
```

`epoch` is UTC seconds. It is accepted only in `[1577836800, 4102444800)` — 2020 through 2099 — and refused outside
that as `invalid epoch`; the lower bound is what distinguishes a real wall clock from an RTC that has never been set,
and the upper bound stops a garbled value becoming a timestamp no later save can beat. Like every other op it requires
`hello` first. Success changes no state: the acknowledgement is the new `device_time` in the `status` the client is
already subscribed to.

`status` always carries `clock_supported`, and carries `device_time` **only when the device actually knows the time**:

```json
{"clock_supported": true, "device_time": 1725600000}
```

- `clock_supported: false` — this board has no RTC. `set_time` is refused with `no clock on this device`, saved
  positions are never timestamped, and this device always loses a conflict. Hide the control.
- `clock_supported: true` with no `device_time` — an RTC that is present but unreadable, or one whose date registers
  hold nonsense. Rare (see seeding, below). Send `set_time`.
- `device_time` present — the normal case. Compare it against your own clock and re-send `set_time` if it has drifted.

`device_time` is never `0`. An unknown time is an absent field, because `0` would read as a real instant in 1970.

### The clock is running before you set it

The RTC ships with a stopped oscillator, so on a brand-new device it would report no time at all until a client sent
`set_time` — and every position the user read in the meantime would be saved unstamped, losing every later conflict.
That limitation is gone: **the firmware seeds the RTC from its own build epoch at boot.**

A device cannot be older than the firmware running on it, so the build epoch is a sound lower bound for wall time. At
every boot the firmware compares the two:

| RTC holds | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| No plausible time (stopped oscillator, garbled registers) | Seeded to the build epoch. |
| A time *before* the build epoch | Advanced to the build epoch — a clock predating its own firmware is wrong. |
| A time at or after the build epoch | Left alone. |

**The clock is never moved backwards**, and a `set_time` from a client always wins: it is the more accurate source and
it is what corrects the seed. The consequence for clients is that `device_time` may be *behind* real time — as far
behind as the firmware's age — until the app corrects it. It is never "unknown".

**Still send `set_time` early.** A seeded clock keeps the device's saves stamped and comparable, but the stamps are
only as good as the seed: two devices on different firmware builds order against each other by build date, not by when
the user actually read. Send `set_time` as soon as `status` arrives and before uploading a `progress` batch.

The clock is a hardware RTC with full date registers (PCF8563 on this board, DS3231 and RX8130 on others), so this is
a genuine wall clock, not a since-boot counter — the firmware does not fall back to one, and the build epoch is the
only date it ever supplies itself. The RTC is read at most every 10 seconds and the reading is carried forward with
the millisecond counter in between, so two saves inside one poll window still order correctly.

## `progress`

`{"op":"start_put","kind":"progress","size":…,"sha256":…}` uploads reading positions from the app to the device. It
uses the ordinary upload machinery — binary frames on `data-in`, credit-based flow control via `ack_bytes`, SHA-256
over the whole document, `commit` — and the same `hello` gate. `name` is not used: the batch is scratch, staged at a
fixed path, and deleted once applied. The document must be at most 512 KB and 8192 entries.

The payload is a JSON array, one object per book:

```json
[
  {"filename":"Dune.epub","location":"0300170023000000","timestamp":1725600000},
  {"filename":"Classics/Ulysses.epub","location":"1a000400","timestamp":1725600123}
]
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `filename` | string | Path relative to `/Books`, exactly as `library` reported it. Required. |
| `location` | string | Hex-encoded saved position (see [Position encoding](#position-encoding)). Required. |
| `timestamp` | number | UTC epoch seconds at which the app believes that position was reached. Required. |

Nothing is written until the whole batch is on the card and its SHA-256 matches, so a transfer cut short cannot
half-apply.

### Conflict rule

An entry is applied **only if `timestamp` is strictly newer than the timestamp stored beside the device's own saved
position for that book.** Otherwise it is skipped and reported `skipped_older`.

- Both sides normally have a real timestamp: the device stamps its own saves from a clock that is running from first
  boot (see [Device clock](#device-clock)), so "two dates, compared" is the ordinary case.
- A device timestamp that is **unknown counts as the oldest possible**, so any valid incoming timestamp wins. Unknown
  now means only: the position was saved by firmware older than this feature, its sidecar was lost or torn, or the
  board has no RTC.
- **Equal timestamps do not apply.** Echoing back what `library` just reported is a no-op, not a rewrite.
- An entry whose `timestamp` is outside the range `set_time` accepts is `invalid`, not applied. There is no path that
  writes a position without a usable timestamp.

### Per-entry results

One bad or unknown entry costs that entry only, never the batch: a book the phone knows about but this card does not
is the ordinary case. Every entry gets one of:

| Result | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `applied` | Written, and stamped with the incoming `timestamp`. |
| `skipped_older` | The device's own save is at least as new. |
| `not_found` | No such file under `/Books`. |
| `unsupported` | A file extension the reader cannot open, so it has no position format. |
| `invalid` | Malformed `filename`, `location` or `timestamp`, or a `location` length the book's reader does not write. |
| `write_failed` | The position could not be persisted (SD error). |

The outcomes are **not** in `status`: a notification carries at most `ATT_MTU - 3` bytes, so a shelf-sized array would
be truncated on the wire with no error. `status` reports only the headline after `commit` —

```json
{"state":"saved","kind":"progress","entries":42,"applied":37}
```

(Deliberately terse: the byte counts an upload normally reports are dropped for this kind so the whole status still
fits in one notification.)

— and the full list is fetched as a download:

```json
{"op":"start_get","kind":"progress_result"}
```

whose payload is a JSON array parallel to the upload, in the same order:

```json
[
  {"filename":"Dune.epub","result":"applied"},
  {"filename":"Classics/Ulysses.epub","result":"skipped_older"}
]
```

It is staged at `/.crosspoint/ble-progress-result.json` and removed when the link stops (deep sleep), so fetch it
in the same session. A batch that fails as a whole (malformed JSON, over the entry cap, or an SD write error) reports
`state: "error"` and produces no result document.

### Currently-open book

**A `progress` batch is refused outright while a book is open.** `start_put` with `kind: "progress"` answers
`state: "error"` with `error: "book open"`; retry when the user has left the reader.

This used to be guaranteed by the architecture rather than checked: the Bluetooth Transfer screen was reached through
`replaceActivity()`, which tore the reader down — final `progress.bin` written — before BLE advertising ever started.
Now that the link outlives every screen, that guarantee is gone, and a batch applied underneath a live reader would be
silently overwritten by that reader's own position when it exits. Refusing is worse for the client than succeeding and
much better than appearing to succeed.

Refused rather than deferred, deliberately: a client already knows how to retry, and a queue of pending shelf writes is
a far larger thing to get right than a retry is.

### Where the timestamp lives

Beside `progress.bin`, in a nine-byte sidecar `progress.time` (magic `CPPT`, a version byte, then the UTC epoch
little-endian), not inside `progress.bin` itself. Two reasons:

1. All three readers dispatch on the **exact byte length** of `progress.bin` — the EPUB reader accepts 4, 6 or 10 and
   treats 10 as "position + visible-text offset". Appending four timestamp bytes would turn a 6-byte position into the
   10-byte form and resume the book at a text offset that is really a clock reading. Length is load-bearing there; it
   cannot carry a trailer.
2. Firmware that predates this must keep opening books written by firmware that has it. An ignored extra file is
   compatible in both directions; a longer `progress.bin` is not.

Backwards compatibility follows from that: **every position saved before this existed has no sidecar, and reads as
"unknown"** — which the conflict rule treats as older than any real timestamp, never as epoch 0. A sidecar that is
short, has the wrong magic, or holds an implausible epoch also reads as unknown. Going forward, though, unknown is the
exception rather than the rule: with the clock seeded at boot, every save this firmware makes on a board with an RTC
writes a sidecar.

`progress.bin` keeps its crash-safe temp-and-rename write (issue #2275). The sidecar is written in place afterwards:
it is nine bytes in a single sector, and a torn write there fails the magic check and degrades to "unknown" — a
skipped sync, not a lost book. A save made while the device has no working clock **deletes** any existing sidecar
rather than leaving a stale one, because a stale stamp would claim a position the user reached just now was reached
much earlier, and let an incoming sync overwrite genuinely fresher reading. That path is now reachable only on a board
with no working RTC.

## The Store: requests over the notify channel

The Store screen (home > Store) browses the phone app's Calibre library live. It is the one part of this
protocol where **the device asks and the app answers**, which needs a mechanism the rest of it does not.

### Why it is shaped this way

BLE GATT is client-driven. The phone is the central and the reader is the peripheral, so the reader cannot
call out — it can only reply to what the phone writes. Everything else in this document fits that: the app
decides to push a book, decides to pull the library, and the reader answers.

A store inverts it. The reader knows which six books are on screen, and it knows the instant the user turns
the page. The app is the only thing that can reach Calibre. Polling from the app would mean either a store
that lags a page turn by seconds or a radio that never sleeps.

So the `status` characteristic — already `notify`, already subscribed to by the app — is used as a **request
channel**. When the reader wants something it puts a `pending` object in the status document and notifies:

```json
{"state":"connected","protocol_version":1,"store_supported":true,"mode":"store",
 "pending":{"req":7,"op":"catalog_page","offset":12,"limit":6,
            "thumb_w":72,"thumb_h":108,"desc_max":160,"timeout_ms":20000}}
```

The app sees the notification, fetches from Calibre, and answers with an **ordinary upload**: `start_put`
with the matching `kind`, framed writes on `data-in`, credit flow control through `ack_bytes`, SHA-256 over
the whole payload, `commit`. The one thing the store adds to an upload is a `req` field. The `hello` gate,
the framing, the hashing and the flow control are all reused untouched — the store is a new question, not a
new transport.

**A notification is a doorbell; a GATT read of `status` is authoritative.** A notification carries at most
`ATT_MTU - 3` bytes — 514 at the 517 the reader asks for, 182 on a client that negotiates the iOS default,
and 20 on one that never exchanges MTUs at all. The full status document is around 570 bytes, so it is
**never** notified. The reader keeps the notified payload at or under **180 bytes**, which is `ATT_MTU - 3`
for the ~185-byte MTU that iOS and most Android stacks settle on, so the doorbell survives a small MTU, a
re-negotiation downwards, and a reconnect that never exchanges.

To stay under that cap the reader drops whole fields, in this order, and stops as soon as the document
fits. It never truncates: a client always receives parseable JSON.

| Dropped | Fields |
| --- | --- |
| first | `protocol_version`, `store_supported`, `clock_supported`, `device_time` |
| then | `has_trusted_host`, `trusted_host`, `paired`, `name`, `path` |
| then | `pending` keeps only `req`, `op` and the `id`/`offset` an answer must quote back |
| then | the transfer counters (`kind`, `received`, `sent`, `size`, `ack_bytes`, `resumable`, `entries`, `applied`) and the `error` / `auth_error` text |
| last | `pending` |
| floor | `{"state":"…"}`, and below that `{}` |

`firmware_name`, `browser_companion_url`, `firmware_ota_supported`, `resume_supported`, `upload_kinds`,
`download_kinds`, `device_id` and `device_nonce` are **read-only**: they are in the document a GATT read returns and
in no notification at any size. None of them change within a session.

`has_trusted_host` was promoted out of that read-only set on purpose. It is the field that separates "you were never
saved here, pair with the code" from "your credential is wrong", and a client that only listens to the doorbell needs
it at exactly the moment its trusted hello was refused.

In practice, at 180 bytes, a `pending` request is notified with its geometry intact and a transfer is
notified with its byte counters intact — the two things a live session cannot work without, since
`received` is the credit ack an upload waits on. **Read the characteristic once after subscribing, keep
the session-constant fields, and merge each notification over them.** `scripts/ble_transfer.py` does
exactly this; see `SESSION_FACT_KEYS`.

### Correlation

`req` is a counter, starting at 1, incremented for every request the reader issues in a session. The reader
has **at most one request outstanding at a time**.

An answer naming any other `req` is refused with `{"state":"error","error":"stale request"}` and changes
nothing on screen — the pending request stays pending. That is what stops a slow reply, arriving after the
user has already paged on, from repainting the screen with the page they left. `req` is not persisted; a
reconnect starts a new session and a new counter.

### Retry

A GATT notification is unacknowledged: there is no ATT-level confirmation that the app received it. So an
outstanding request is **re-notified every 4 s, up to 4 times**, carrying the same `req`. An app that saw
the first copy answers once; the later copies name a request it has already answered and are ignored.

### Timeout

| Request | Deadline |
| --- | --- |
| `catalog_page`, `catalog_detail` | 20 s from issue to the answering `start_put` |
| `catalog_fetch` | 45 s from issue to the answering `start_put` |

The fetch window is longer because Calibre may convert a format before the app can begin sending. **The
clock stops when the upload starts** — from there the ordinary transfer machinery reports progress and owns
the failure.

A request that is not answered by its deadline fails **visibly**: the screen reads *The phone did not
answer* with the reason underneath and a Retry hint. It never hangs and it never silently shows stale
content. The request id still advances, so the reply that eventually arrives is refused as stale rather than
painted over whatever the user did next.

The app can also give up early rather than let the reader sit out the whole window:

```json
{"op":"catalog_error","req":7,"error":"calibre unreachable"}
```

`req` must be the outstanding request or the message is ignored. `error` is truncated to 96 bytes and shown
to the user verbatim.

### What the device shows when the app is absent or slow

**The Store requires the app to be open and connected.** There is no cached catalogue and no offline
browsing, by construction: nothing about the catalogue is written to the card except the covers of the page
currently on screen, and those are deleted when the screen closes or the link drops.

| Situation | Screen |
| --- | --- |
| No app connected, or connected but not yet through `hello` | *The Store needs your phone* — pairing code and the companion QR code |
| Request outstanding | *Asking your phone* / *Fetching from Calibre*, Back cancels |
| Deadline passed, or `catalog_error` | *The phone did not answer* + reason, Select retries, Back leaves |
| Link dropped mid-browse | Everything on screen is discarded and it returns to *The Store needs your phone* |

## The catalogue container

A page is text (titles, authors, a blurb) and pictures (a cover per book). Base64 inside JSON would cost a
third more bytes on a link where bytes are the whole constraint, and would force the reader to hold a
decoded page in RAM. So a `catalog_page` / `catalog_detail` payload is one binary blob:

| Offset | Bytes | Field |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 4 | magic, ASCII `CPCT` |
| 4 | 1 | version, currently `1` |
| 5 | 1 | flags, reserved, must be `0` |
| 6 | 2 | `jsonLen`, little-endian uint16 |
| 8 | `jsonLen` | the JSON header, UTF-8, no trailing NUL |
| 8 + `jsonLen` | … | the thumbnails, concatenated in `items` order |

Each thumbnail occupies exactly as many bytes as its item's `thumb` field says; an item with `"thumb":0`
(or no `thumb`) contributes nothing and is listed without art. The blob's total length must equal
`8 + jsonLen + sum(thumb)`.

Caps: `jsonLen` ≤ 6144, any single `thumb` ≤ 8192, the whole container ≤ 64 KB. A container that breaks any
of them is refused whole — nothing partial is ever shown.

### How the device handles it without holding it

The blob is staged on SD by the ordinary upload path (part file, hash, rename on commit), exactly like a
`progress` batch. Only then is it opened: the header is read into RAM (kilobytes, capped), and each
thumbnail is copied **card-to-card** into its own small `.bmp` under `/.crosspoint/store/`, 512 bytes at a
time. The staged blob is deleted immediately afterwards. The covers are then drawn straight off the card by
the same `Bitmap` + `GfxRenderer::drawBitmap1Bit` path the book covers use.

Nothing larger than the JSON header and one 512-byte copy buffer is ever resident, so a page costs the same
RAM whether its covers are 1 KB or 8 KB each. This is the same "stage, then serve" shape as
`src/util/BookLibraryIndex.cpp`.

### Thumbnail format

**1-bit uncompressed Windows BMP, bottom-up, 2-entry palette (index 0 black `0x000000`, index 1 white
`0xFFFFFF`), `biCompression = BI_RGB`.** The app must dither — it has the CPU and the original artwork, the
reader has neither.

| Use | Size | Row stride | Bytes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| List thumbnail (`catalog_page`) | 72 × 108 | 9 | 62 + 9 × 108 = **1034** |
| Detail cover (`catalog_detail`) | 144 × 216 | 18 | 62 + 18 × 216 = **3950** |

The reader sends the dimensions it wants in `thumb_w` / `thumb_h` on every request, so these are the current
values rather than a contract. A BMP of some other size still draws — `drawBitmap` scales it down to fit —
but it costs bytes for pixels that are then thrown away.

Why 1-bit rather than greyscale: a 4-bit 72 × 108 cover is 3.9 KB against 1.03 KB, which is the difference
between a page arriving in about a second and one taking four. Why 72 px wide: it is a whole number of bytes
per row, and 72 × 108 is the largest 2:3 cover that lets six rows fit a 480 × 800 portrait screen under the
header and the button hints.

**Per-page payload: six covers at 1034 bytes plus roughly 3 KB of JSON, so about 9 KB.**

## `catalog_page`

Request (in `status`):

```json
{"pending":{"req":7,"op":"catalog_page","offset":12,"limit":6,
            "thumb_w":72,"thumb_h":108,"desc_max":160,"timeout_ms":20000}}
```

`offset` is a zero-based index into the app's whole (possibly filtered or sorted — that is the app's choice,
and it must be stable within a session) library view. `limit` is always 6 today.

Answer: `{"op":"start_put","kind":"catalog_page","req":7,"size":…,"sha256":…}` then the container, whose
JSON header is:

```json
{"req":7,"offset":12,"total":842,
 "items":[
   {"id":"1234","title":"Dune","author":"Frank Herbert",
    "description":"Set on the desert planet Arrakis…","filename":"Dune.epub",
    "format":"epub","size":1048576,"thumb":1034}
 ]}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `req` | number | Must equal the request's `req`. Anything else is `stale request`. |
| `offset` | number | Echo of the request's `offset`; the reader shows it in the page footer. |
| `total` | number | Books in the whole view. **This is what makes pagination possible** — without it the reader cannot know whether a next page exists. |
| `items[].id` | string | Opaque handle, ≤ 64 bytes, printable ASCII, no `"` or `\`. Sent straight back in `catalog_detail` and `catalog_fetch`. Required. |
| `items[].title` | string | Truncated to 160 bytes. Falls back to `id` when empty. |
| `items[].author` | string | Truncated to 128 bytes. May be empty. |
| `items[].description` | string | **Truncated by the app to `desc_max` = 160 bytes**, and re-truncated on the device on a code-point boundary if it is not. One or two lines under the title is all a row can show. |
| `items[].filename` | string | What the app would name the file if it sent this book. Same rules as the `book` upload kind (≤ 96 bytes, alphanumeric plus `. _ -` and space, no leading dot). An entry without a usable one is listed but cannot be fetched. |
| `items[].format` | string | `epub`, `txt`, … Display only. |
| `items[].size` | number | Bytes, display only. |
| `items[].thumb` | number | Length of this item's BMP in the blob. `0` or absent means no cover. |

`onDevice` is deliberately **not** a wire field: whether `/Books/<filename>` already exists is answered on
the device, per entry, because the app cannot know what is on the card.

A page with no items and a non-zero `total` is refused as `empty catalog page`; a genuinely empty library is
`total: 0` with an empty `items`.

## `catalog_detail`

Tapping a row asks for the book:

```json
{"pending":{"req":8,"op":"catalog_detail","id":"1234",
            "thumb_w":144,"thumb_h":216,"desc_max":1024,"timeout_ms":20000}}
```

Answered with `kind: "catalog_detail"`, the same container, one `item` instead of `items`:

```json
{"req":8,"id":"1234",
 "item":{"id":"1234","title":"Dune","author":"Frank Herbert","format":"epub",
         "size":1048576,"filename":"Dune.epub","thumb":3950,
         "description":"…up to 1024 bytes…"}}
```

**Why a second round trip rather than reusing what the page already sent.** The list carries a 160-byte
snippet; the detail view wants the whole blurb, and a cover four times the area. Carrying 1 KB descriptions
and 3950-byte covers for six books in every page payload would take a page from ~9 KB to ~30 KB — more than
triple the cost of the frequent action (turning a page) to save one round trip on the rarer one (opening a
book). On a link this slow the page turn is what has to be fast. The round trip costs roughly a second,
which is about what the panel spends on a full repaint anyway, and the screen says *Asking your phone* while
it happens.

## `catalog_fetch`

The detail view's button. The reader publishes:

```json
{"pending":{"req":9,"op":"catalog_fetch","id":"1234","name":"Dune.epub","timeout_ms":45000}}
```

and the app answers with the **existing `book` upload kind**, plus the `req`:

```json
{"op":"start_put","kind":"book","req":9,"name":"Dune.epub","size":1048576,"sha256":"…"}
```

In store mode a `book` upload is accepted **only** as the answer to an outstanding `catalog_fetch`, and only
when `name` matches the `name` the request published. Anything else is refused (`stale request` /
`unexpected book`): the user asked for one specific book and an unsolicited push must not land on the card in
its place. Outside store mode the `book` kind is unchanged and needs no `req`.

From `start_put` onwards this is an ordinary upload. The Store screen shows a progress bar fed by the same
byte counts `status` reports, and on `commit` the file is renamed into `/Books` and the screen becomes *Added
to your books* with Select to open it.

**A book that is already on the device** never reaches this path: the catalogue page marked it `onDevice`
from the card, the detail view's button reads *On this device* and opens the local copy instead of asking for
a copy. If the file appears between the page arriving and the button being pressed, the ordinary `exists`
error surfaces on the Store screen.

## What the Store leaves on the card

Only the covers of the page and the detail currently on screen, under `/.crosspoint/store/` and
`/.crosspoint/store/detail/`, plus the staged container while a transfer is in flight. All of it is deleted
when the Store screen closes, and the page/detail covers are also dropped the moment the link drops. Nothing
about the catalogue survives a session.

## Explicit Non-goals

This protocol deliberately stays within CrossPoint Reader's project scope. CrossPoint does not support packages,
plugins, or package-state diagnostics, so the BLE service does not add package uploads or package-state downloads. It
also does not expose arbitrary SD-card browsing, arbitrary path reads, or arbitrary path writes.

Those operations belong in Marginalia or other forks that choose a package/plugin model. They are not reserved for a
later CrossPoint BLE iteration.

## Status Capabilities

Status JSON includes capability fields so clients can hide unsupported controls:

```json
{
  "protocol_version": 1,
  "firmware_name": "CrossPoint Reader",
  "upload_kinds": ["book", "bmp", "firmware", "progress", "catalog_page", "catalog_detail"],
  "download_kinds": ["crash_report", "library", "progress_result"],
  "store_supported": true,
  "firmware_ota_supported": true,
  "clock_supported": true,
  "device_time": 1725600000,
  "browser_companion_url": "https://ble.xteink.lol/"
}
```

`device_time` is present only when the device knows the time; see [Device clock](#device-clock).
`store_supported` says this firmware speaks the Store request protocol. There is no longer a `"mode"` field: the link
is not a screen and has no mode. `firmware_ota_supported` still means "this reader accepts the `firmware` upload
kind"; what it does with it is now the file drop described above.

The states `confirming`, `updating`, `restarting`, `save_host_prompt` and `forget_host_prompt` no longer exist —
nothing the link does needs a prompt on screen any more. `has_trusted_host` and `auth_error` are new in notifications.

**Every field above comes from a GATT read of `status`, not from a
notification** — the whole document is ~570 bytes and no notification is large enough to carry it. Read the
characteristic after subscribing and merge notifications over what it gave you; see
[The Store](#the-store-requests-over-the-notify-channel) for the exact rule.

Clients should still handle `state: "error"` for rejected operations.
